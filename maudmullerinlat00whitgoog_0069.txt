And still my brein with life and vigor teems‚

And many a spark there is within, I kn0w;

And e³en the air, that ’gainst my cheek doth blow,
To me a stirring Deity’s breath but seems.

Time is when, yielding to my fervid dreams‚
Along untrodden, flowery paths Ι go,

Then to my lips clear strains harmonious flow,
And Hope alost, rekindled, brightly gleams.

But when grim Doubt awakeS‚ and through the haze
Of tranquil mom, the phantoms I pursued,
Waning, desert my chamber bleak and nude,

Behind my palms Ι screen mine eyes and gaze
At this poor heart and ask the question cool:
“Am I a Poet oram I a Fool?’'
