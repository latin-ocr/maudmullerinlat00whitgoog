The Venal lVIuse.

Cunnnns Bnunmmn.

My Muse, through lofty mansions fain to creep,
Wilt thou, when winter storms bring rain and sleet,
When snowy nights our hearts in tedium steep‚
Find some hot embers for thy frozen feet?

Wilt thou thy shoulderS, white as manble, heat
With rays of night that through the window peep?
With empty punse and dinnerless retreat,

Wilt thou the gold of yonder heaven neap?

Thon must, if thou would'st earn a daily bread,
As choristers are wont, a censer swing
And mock Te Deums just as meekly sing,

Or, as a tasting circus-dancer, spread
Thy charms and laugh and jest and sport alond‚
With nnseen tearS, to entertain a crowd.
