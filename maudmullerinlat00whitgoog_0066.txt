To His Lady.

Senecam.

Some night when sitting on thy balcony
Beneath the star-lit heaven blue and clear,

A far-off cry, perchance, may reaeh thine ear,
A waning, far-off cry salnting thee.

Some day, perchanceâ€š upon this fated lea,
Where first we met, thou wilt perceive a tear,
But like to dew on flow'r it will appear,

And thou shalt culi the floweret for thee.

Nay, lady, nay! That is no trembling dew
Suu-bathed and sparkling with a silves-hue.
It is a trace of my repining eyes.

That wail is not the distant wind that sighs.
Itis thy lover dying, who has sent
His kiss to thee and his extreme lament.

W&
