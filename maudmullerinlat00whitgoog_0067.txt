Sisccflsnn.

Bacchanal irenzies in our spirit ring,

And hermits' holy visions we behold;

We are the martyrS, we, the prophets bold,
We to the world a mighty ⁴⁴ Forward! '' fling.

To moonlit flow'rs and wandering stars we sing:
To us doth Love his secrets all unfold:

Our hearts alone the sacred hymns can monld:
From ηε, the Poets, do they skyward spring.

Ye barterers‚ ye mongers, all your hate
And wrath ’gainst more pernicious arts bestir:
No cheating schemes of lucre do we utter,

No weights, we bards, no drugs adulterate.
Why should ye rave, if roses we prefer
To tallow, to potatoes ¹and to b'utter? λ
