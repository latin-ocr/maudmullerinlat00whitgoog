Memento.

Leaenzo Senecam.

When Carnival's mad orgies through the street
Attract thine eye to jocund revels flying,
Remember‚ oh remember, maiden sweet,

That some one in a hospital is dying.

When joyful thou goest forth to dances fleet‚
In gentleness all other maids outvying‚
Turn back, oh turn, and thou wilt ever meet
Distress upon the threshold ever crying.

When Love, like unto sunbeam gay, shall dart ·
From ’neath thy lids his heavenly caresseS,
Think that to many Love no raptures gave.

· When thou thy mirror view'st‚ let speak thine beart,
And tell thee that a pearl from thy fair tresses,
One lonely pearl, an ebbing life may save.
