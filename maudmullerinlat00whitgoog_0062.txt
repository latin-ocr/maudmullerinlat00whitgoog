To Vergil.

G10sue CARDUCCI.

As upon withered fields, serenely streaming‚

Pours dewy balm at eventide the moon,

While rills meander through the meadows gleaming‚
And softly murmur with their silver tune;

Renews the nightingale‚ 'mid foliage beaming
With radiant mist, his melody of June;
Listens the weary wayfarer, and, dreaming

of youthful love, forgets all labor soom

Bereft a mother, grieving all the while,
Now turns her lids to the refulgent sky
From yonder tomb and ceases to repine -

Meantime the far-off sea and upland smile;
'Mid lofty trees refreshing breezes sigh —
Such is, o Bard, to me thy Song divine.
