The Italian Sonnet.

CARnucm.

On cherub’s wing it soared through Dante's art
Enwrapped in ether, golden-hued and blue,
And sweetest plaints and softest tears it knew
Divinely streaming from Petrarca's heart.

To it Torquato nectar did impart -
Mantova’s nectar and Venosa’s dew,

By Muses favored. Thrall and tyrant slew
Alfieri with this adamantine dart.

Then came the nightingales at Ugo’s voice
From their Ionian, verdant cypress·trees,
As he bedecked it with acanthus-blooms.

Not sixth‚ but last, evoking wrath and joys‚
Perfumes and tearS, despair and ecstasies‚
I sing in my seclusion to the tombs.
