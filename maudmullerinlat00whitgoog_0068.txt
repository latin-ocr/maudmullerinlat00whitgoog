Smccussffi.

No more, no more Prometheus' taunt hath pealed
Superbly smiting the revengeful God,

And strikes no more the cowardS, like a rod,

The verse that lashes and will never yield.

His sword no more great Aeschylus doth wield
On tragic scene forever left untr0d;

Unknown his ashes lie below the sod

Far, far away from Marathon's green field.

But Thais, the mime‚ her hunger to allay,
Our modern weary Ciacchi will allum,
And ply her dances with a shameless guile.

In nausea steeped we lie, without a ray
Of noble love within, on the manure
Of this revolting age. Bah! we are vile.
